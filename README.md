# The Colour Factor


We're a team of mental health educators that have noticed a gap in services for the BIPOC+ Community (Black, Indigenous, People of Colour) that we'd like to help address.

Our intention is to start with breaking down the stories we tell ourselves and the stories that have been told about us, by creating a safe space of healing.

Join the team, as we focus on self-love, the relationship with our hearts and learn about belonging to ourselves.

Mission:
Promote racial awareness by creating safe spaces of healing for the BIPOC+ (Black, Indigenous, People of Colour) community through conversation, collaboration and creativity

Values:
Dignity, Identity, Compassion, Truth & Reconciliation

“Inclusion is not an opportunity, it’s a necessity”
